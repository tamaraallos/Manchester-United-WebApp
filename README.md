## Credits
This project was developed by Tamara Allos as an initiative to enhance her skills in web development.
I would like to give credit to the Offical Manchester Website as inspirations as well as where I got my images
from under my 'Player's page'. This is NOT an offical Manchester United website. I used Manchester United images
and logo for educational purposes.
